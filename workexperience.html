                    My main responsibility was to ensure that project implementations of Apttus products
                    meet various business requirements from customers. Here I worked with

                <p>During my work time at Gameloft my main responsibility was to test various technical
                    aspects of the AUT against a predefined checklist. This checklist was mandatory for
                    all games, created by Gameloft and included features like Social Networks, Memory,

                    In addition to that I have performed various tests against the game documentation,
                    specific for each individual project. These include activities such: gameplay,
                    localization, verifying whether the implementation of levels, features, items, menus
                    layout and overall design, complies with the provided game documentation.
